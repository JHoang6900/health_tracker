# Full Stack Health Tracker App

***

## Project Overview

Developed a robust personal health monitoring application designed to continuously track and visualize critical vital signs, directly addressing real-world caregiving challenges. This project demonstrates proficiency in building data-driven applications, leveraging modern APIs, and designing user-centric interfaces.

By tracking various health metrics including:

- Date & Time
- Blood Pressure
- Pulse
- O2 
- Temperature
- and Respiration

Users can track their progress over time and make informed decisions about their lifestyle choices and healthcare decisions. 

The primary goal of the project is to provide users with a user friendly interface to input and visualize their health data efficiently. The app aims to empower individuals to take control of their health by offering them a convenient tool to monitor their vital statistics and identify any trends or patterns that may affect their well-being.
Using modern web technologies such as Vite, TailwindCSS, React, JavaScript, MySQL, and D3.js, the Health Tracker App offers a simple experience for users to interact with their health data, whether it's viewing historical records, analyzing trends, or setting personal health goals.
