# Full Stack Health Tracker App

***

## Project Overview

Developed a practical personal health monitoring application designed to continuously track and visualize critical vital signs, directly addressing real world caregiving challenges. This project demonstrates proficiency in building data driven applications, leveraging modern APIs, and designing user friendly interfaces.

By tracking various health metrics including:

- Date & Time
- Blood Pressure
- Pulse
- O2 
- Temperature
- and Respiration

Users can track their progress over time and make informed decisions about their lifestyle choices and healthcare decisions. 

The primary goal of the project is to provide users with a user friendly interface to input and visualize their health data efficiently. The app aims to empower individuals to take control of their health by offering them a convenient tool to monitor their vital statistics and identify any trends or patterns that may affect their well-being.
Using modern web technologies such as Vite, TailwindCSS, React, JavaScript, MySQL, and D3.js, the Health Tracker App offers a simple experience for users to interact with their health data, whether it's viewing historical records, analyzing trends, or setting personal health goals.

## Key Features & Demonstrated Skills:

- *Full-Stack Development:* Engineered robust applications integrating React frontends, Node.js/Express.js backends, and relational databases (e.g., MySQL, SQL Server).

- *Secure User Authentication:* Implemented secure user authentication (bcrypt, express-session) with protected routes for sensitive data access.

- *RESTful API Design & Implementation:* Developed comprehensive RESTful APIs with CRUD operations across various entities (e.g., Patients, Users, Vitals), including advanced queries for specific data (e.g., latest vital signs). Demonstrated expertise in working with external APIs (e.g., Withings Health API for automated vital sign retrieval, handling API authentication, and managing asynchronous data calls).

- *Cloud & Data Management:* Designed and implemented systems for pulling and processing raw data from cloud-based services (e.g., Withings' cloud), preparing it for persistent storage and analysis. Utilized databases (e.g., MySQL, SQL Server) for efficient data storage and retrieval, managing data integrity with foreign key constraints and optimizing SQL queries (complex joins).

- *Frontend Development* (React & Vite): Built responsive and interactive user interfaces using React (Vite build tool), utilizing modern hooks (useState, useEffect, useParams, useNavigate) for efficient state management and navigation. Designed for real-time and historical vital sign display, focusing on clarity and ease of access for users/caregivers.

- *Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS:* Designed mobile-first, responsive UIs with Tailwind CSS, ensuring optimal display and user experience across various screen sizes.

- *Data Visualization & Trend Analysis:* Developed intuitive graphical representations (e.g., line graphs for vital sign trends like blood pressure, heart rate) to visualize measurements over time, showcasing skills in data interpretation and charting libraries (e.g., D3.js).

- *API Integration (Axios):* Seamlessly integrated frontends with backend APIs using Axios for asynchronous data fetching, form submissions, and response processing. Configured secure cross-origin communication (cors, withCredentials).

- *Environmental Variable Management:* Secured sensitive database credentials and application secrets using dotenv for best-practice configuration management.

- *Problem-Solving & Independent Development:* Independently conceived, designed, and implemented technical solutions to address real-world needs (e.g., personal caregiving challenges), demonstrating strong problem-solving abilities, project management, and self-driven learning.

- *Attention to Detail & Accuracy:* Ensured precise data measurement display (e.g., in mmHg for blood pressure) for clinical relevance and accurate data presentation.


## Project Architecture

This section describes the architecture of the project including technologies used, database schema, and system design.
Throw wireframes under Front End, and database schemas under Back End.

### Technologies

-  Vite
- TailwindCSS
- React
- JavaScript
-  MySQL
-  D3.js

### Front End

Discuss how the frontend interacts with the backend and how data is fetched, processed, and displayed to the user.

*TODO: add a wireframe here to reference how the UI will look like*

### Back End

Describe the backend architecture, including the structure of the server-side application, API endpoints, data models, and any external services or databases used for backend development.

*TODO: add a database schema here to reference our backend structure*
