# Full Stack Health Tracker App

***

## Project Overview

The Health Tracker App is designed to help individuals monitor and visualize their health statistics to gain insights into their overall well-being. By inputting various health metrics including:

- Date & Time
- Blood Pressure
- Pulse
- O2 
- Temperature
- and Respiration

Users can track their progress over time and make informed decisions about their lifestyle choices.

The primary goal of the project is to provide users with a user friendly interface to input and visualize their health data efficiently. The app aims to empower individuals to take control of their health by offering them a convenient tool to monitor their vital statistics and identify any trends or patterns that may affect their well-being.

Using modern web technologies such as Vite, TailwindCSS, React, JavaScript, MySQL, and D3.js, the Health Tracker App offers a simple experience for users to interact with their health data, whether it's viewing historical records, analyzing trends, or setting personal health goals.

## Team Roles

- Full Stack Lead: Overall App design and functionality
- Front End: User Interface and visuals
- Back End: User Login, Logic, and databases
- Product Research: Wireframe/Readme/Foundation setting

*TODO: choose which roles you want to primarily be working on for the duration of this App & send out a message in DunDrag. Roles are not locked into place, but gives general guidelines on structure without stepping onto each other's toes so we can be flexible as needed/wanted.*

## Project Architecture

This section describes the architecture of the project including technologies used, database schema, and system design.
Throw wireframes under Front End, and database schemas under Back End.

### Technologies

-  Vite
- TailwindCSS
- React
- JavaScript
-  MySQL
-  D3.js

### Front End

Discuss how the frontend interacts with the backend and how data is fetched, processed, and displayed to the user.

*TODO: add a wireframe here to reference how the UI will look like*

### Back End

Describe the backend architecture, including the structure of the server-side application, API endpoints, data models, and any external services or databases used for backend development.

*TODO: add a database schema here to reference our backend structure*
